FizzBuzz

Description
This mini project will showcase how I put together javascript functions to make this application work.

Overview
Hi there! To this date (06-Nov-2022), I'm fairly new in coding. I'm trying to code a popular game to teach children division. I have seen this game in the Odin Project, which is my main content on learning web development. Mainly, this is to test my skills on how to make relatively simple application with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. At this point I know know some Linux, Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS and JavaScript thanks to the Odin Project. There's nothing special in this project rather you could find a lot of areas of improvement. If so, I would love to learn from you. 

Application blueprint  
1. The user will input a number in a text box.
2. The value from the input will be stored in a JavaScript function
3. Another function will make an array based from the number given by the user.
    a. Example, if the user typed 40 a function will make an array of 1 to 40.
4. Another function will replace a number that are divisible by 3, 5, and both 3 and 5 with text.
    a. Numbers that are divisible by 3 will get replaced by "fizz"
    b. Numbers that are divisible by 5 will get replaced by "buzz"
    c. Numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 will be replaced by "fizzbuzz"
